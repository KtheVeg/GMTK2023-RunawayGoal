# Runaway Goal
A game I made in less than 48 hours

Thanks for checking out the source code. It's a bit of a mess... You can find everything I used to make the game, from blender files to actual game models. Feel free to open the project for yourself and have fun with it

# Credits
- SSUnlimited (Added a rig to the *thing* I made)
- Unity Technologies (Grabbed the third-person character controller from the asset store)

# Building
There isn't anything special for building. Open and build.
